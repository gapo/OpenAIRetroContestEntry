## Entry to OpenAI Contest  

### Introduction

This is my [official entry](https://contest.openai.com/2018-1/users/831/) into the OpenAI retro contest and the collection of scripts associated with that. 

### Running

- Clone the retro contest from OpenAI's [repo](https://github.com/openai/retro)
- Adjust the agent by modifying the file inside the agents folder
- Run setupDockerRegistry.sh


### Fin

The contest is over. THerefore I did not see the point in hiding the username / password. 

I ended up at #80 having reached the lofty heights of #50.
